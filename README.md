# Superchain Vaults

Superchain Vaults is a cross-chain staking, yield and lending reference implementation and demo platform.
It combines ERC-4626 style spoke vaults, a ControllerHub for lending markets, and a SuperVaultHub / SuperchainAdapter messaging layer for cross-chain orchestration. The repository is designed for developers, auditors, and demonstrators who want a production-minded, testable framework to explore cross-chain liquidity and LST (liquid staking token) mechanics.

Key features
- Per-spoke ERC-4626 vaults that mint an LST mirror token on deposit.
- ControllerHub for multi-market lending with health factor checks and liquidation flows.
- SuperVaultHub and SuperchainAdapter primitives for cross-chain credit, routing and nonce-protected messages.
- AdapterRegistry and strategy adapters (mockable) for yield generation and allocation.
- Foundry-based test suite (unit/integration/property/invariant) with scenario harnesses and mocks.

This repository contains both production-grade patterns (two-step governance, role gating, replay guards) and test harnesses (MockBridge, MockL2ToL2Messenger, MockAggregators) to illustrate and stress cross-chain flows.

Quickstart (local)
1. Install Foundry: https://book.getfoundry.sh/
2. Build the project:

```bash
FOUNDRY_PROFILE=scripts forge build
```

3. Run tests (via-IR scripts profile used for complex deployments):

```bash
FOUNDRY_PROFILE=scripts forge test -vv
```

4. Deploy mock tokens for demo (local or testnet): see `scripts/DeployMocks.s.sol` and `README-MOCKS.md`.

How it works (high level)
- Vaults: `SpokeYieldVault` is an ERC-4626 vault that issues a separate `SuperchainERC20` LST token on deposit and burns it on redeem. Vaults hold adapters which can be allocated assets and harvested to produce yield.
- Lending: `ControllerHub` lists markets (linking underlying asset and LST) and allows borrowing constrained by LTV and protocol risk parameters. Liquidations call into vaults to seize user shares.
- Cross-chain: `SuperVaultHub` coordinates remote operations. In tests the `MockBridge` and `MockL2ToL2Messenger` simulate asynchronous token movement and messages. For demos, a keeper-assisted relayer can call privileged hooks (e.g., `onRemoteCredit`) to credit assets across chains.

Testnet demo notes
- For quick demos we recommend a keeper-assisted approach: a small off-chain relayer that mints demo yield tokens, triggers `onRemoteCredit`, and sets oracle feeds on testnets. This is faster and more reliable than relying on third-party testnet bridges for demo purposes.
- See `README-MOCKS.md` for instructions on deploying mock tokens and setting up `PriceOracleRouter` feeds.

Security & governance
- Roles are strictly used: `GOVERNOR_ROLE`, `REBALANCER_ROLE`, `HUB_ROLE`, `CONTROLLER_ROLE`, and deploy-time `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` are all enforced by AccessControl.
- Emergency controls: vaults expose `forceIdle()` and contracts are pausable where appropriate. For public testnets, grant critical roles to a secure multisig and maintain a runbook for emergency pause and role revocation.

## Production deployment notes

- Mock adapters are disabled in production (allowlist=false, cap=0). They are marked MockOnly â€” NOT for production deployments.
- Required env vars (example .env):

	- GOV_MULTISIG, TIMELOCK, BASE_ASSET
	- RESERVE_FACTOR_BPS, LTV_BPS, LT_BPS, KINK_BPS, SLOPE1_RAY, SLOPE2_RAY
	- WITHDRAW_BUFFER_BPS, EPOCH_LEN_SEC, EPOCH_OUTFLOW_CAP_BPS
	- Per-asset oracle group (repeatable): FEED_<SYMBOL>_PRIMARY, FEED_<SYMBOL>_SECONDARY, FEED_<SYMBOL>_DECIMALS, FEED_<SYMBOL>_HEARTBEAT, FEED_<SYMBOL>_DEV_BPS, FEED_<SYMBOL>_MIN, FEED_<SYMBOL>_MAX
	- Optional sequencer oracle: SEQUENCER_ORACLE

- Post-deploy runbook:
	- Grant GOVERNOR_ROLE and DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE to the timelock; revoke from deployer and any EOAs.
	- Configure oracle feeds and bounds on `PriceOracleRouter`.
	- Set vault withdrawal buffer and epoch caps.
	- Keep `AdapterRegistry` paused until allowlist/caps are finalized; then selectively enable real adapters.
	- Validate invariants with the smoke section in the deploy scripts.

- Strategy adapters: AaveV3Adapter, VelodromeLPAdapter via BaseAdapter and AdapterRegistry.
- Rewards: PerChainRewardsDistributor; EmissionsController.
- Oracles: PriceOracleRouter.
- Lending: ControllerHub.
